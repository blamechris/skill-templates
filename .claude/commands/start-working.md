# /start-working

Scan all work sources — GitHub issues, open PRs, roadmap files, audit outputs, codebase TODOs — to determine what to work on next. If nothing actionable is found, perform a lightweight codebase audit to surface potential investigations.

This skill is **read-only** — it never writes files, creates issues, or commits. It's a triage tool that feeds naturally into `/autonomous-dev-flow` or manual work.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Optional filters. Space-separated tokens:
  - `focus=AREA` — Narrow to a specific area (e.g., `focus=testing`, `focus=security`, `focus=performance`)
  - `limit=N` — Max items to show per source (default: 10)
  - `include-closed` — Also scan recently closed issues (last 7 days) for context
  - If empty, scan everything with defaults

Examples:
```
/start-working
/start-working focus=testing
/start-working limit=5
/start-working focus=security include-closed
```

## Instructions

### 0. Setup

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
REPO_NAME=$(basename "$REPO")
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name)
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for `focus`, `limit` (default 10), and `include-closed` flag.

Read CLAUDE.md and any `.claude/rules/` files to understand the project's conventions, priorities, and known issues.

### 1. Gather Work Sources

Collect data from all sources. Run independent queries in parallel where possible.

#### 1a. GitHub Issues

```bash
# Open issues sorted by updated date (most recent activity first)
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels,assignees,milestone,createdAt,updatedAt --limit 50

# If include-closed flag set, also grab recently closed for context
gh issue list --state closed --json number,title,labels,closedAt --limit 20
```

Categorize each open issue:

| Category | Detection |
|----------|-----------|
| Blocked | Has label matching: `blocked`, `wontfix`, `needs-design`, `on-hold` |
| Assigned | Has assignees (someone is already working on it) |
| Ready | Issues with `enhancement` or `bug` labels and acceptance criteria in the body |
| Backlog | Open, unassigned, not blocked, but no explicit "ready" signal |

For "Ready" and "Backlog" issues, read the issue body to check for acceptance criteria:

```bash
gh issue view ${ISSUE_NUM} --json body -q .body
```

Issues with clear acceptance criteria rank higher than vague ones.

#### 1b. Open PRs Needing Attention

```bash
# All open PRs with review and check status
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,author,reviewDecision,isDraft,headRefName,createdAt,updatedAt --limit 20
```

Flag PRs that need attention:

| Signal | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `reviewDecision: CHANGES_REQUESTED` | Review feedback needs addressing |
| `isDraft: true` | Work in progress — may be stale |
| Stale (no update in 7+ days) | Forgotten PR — needs decision (finish, close, or rebase) |

Also check CI status for open PRs:

```bash
# For each open PR, check if CI is failing
gh pr checks ${PR_NUM} --json name,state --jq '[.[] | select(.state != "SUCCESS" and .state != "SKIPPED")]'
```

#### 1c. Roadmap and Planning Files

Scan for planning documents in common locations:

```bash
# Check for common planning files (don't fail on missing)
for f in ROADMAP.md TODO.md CHANGELOG.md; do
  test -f "$f" && echo "Found: $f"
done

# Check common planning directories
for d in docs/roadmap docs/planning docs/TODO; do
  test -d "$d" && echo "Found: $d/" && ls "$d"
done
```

Search for these files (check existence, don't fail if missing):
- `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (for recent/planned entries)
- `docs/roadmap/`, `docs/planning/`, `docs/TODO/`

For each found file, scan for:
- Unchecked items (`- [ ]`)
- Sections labeled "Planned", "Next", "Upcoming", "TODO", "Backlog"
- Items not yet represented as GitHub issues

#### 1d. Audit Output Files

Check for existing audit reports:

```bash
# Look for project-audit output
ls docs/project-audit/ 2>/dev/null
ls docs/audits/ 2>/dev/null

# Also check for from-audit issues that are still open
gh issue list --state open --label "from-audit" --json number,title,labels --limit 20 2>/dev/null

# And from-review issues (deferred work from PR reviews)
gh issue list --state open --label "from-review" --json number,title,labels --limit 20 2>/dev/null
```

If audit reports exist, read the master assessment for any unaddressed recommendations (check if corresponding issues exist).

#### 1e. Codebase TODOs

Scan for TODO/FIXME/HACK markers in source code:

```bash
# Search for actionable markers in Bash and Markdown files
find . -type f \( -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.md" \) \
  ! -path "./node_modules/*" \
  ! -path "./.godot/*" \
  ! -path "./build/*" \
  ! -path "./dist/*" \
  -exec grep -Hn "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX\|WORKAROUND" {} \;
```

Use Grep to find `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`, and `WORKAROUND` markers in source files. Exclude:
- `node_modules/`, `.godot/`, `build/`, `dist/`, vendor directories
- Test fixtures and generated files
- Lock files

Collect file path, line number, and the marker text for each hit.

### 2. Prioritize and Deduplicate

#### 2a. Assign Priority Tiers

Map every finding to a unified priority tier:

| Tier | Label | Signals |
|------|-------|---------|
| P0 | Immediate | PRs with `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, open `bug` issues, failing CI on open PRs |
| P1 | High | `enhancement` or `bug` labels with acceptance criteria, `from-review` issues, milestone-assigned issues, stale PRs |
| P2 | Normal | `enhancement` issues with acceptance criteria, `from-audit` issues, roadmap items |
| P3 | Exploratory | Codebase TODOs, vague issues without criteria, audit recommendations without issues |

If `focus=AREA` was specified, boost items matching that area by one tier (P2→P1, P3→P2).

#### 2b. Deduplicate

Cross-reference findings across sources:
- If a roadmap item already has a GitHub issue → keep the issue, drop the roadmap entry (note the link)
- If an audit recommendation already has a `from-audit` issue → keep the issue, drop the audit entry
- If a TODO in code references an issue number (e.g., `TODO(#42)`) → link to the issue, don't list separately
- If multiple TODOs relate to the same theme → group them as one item

#### 2c. Apply Focus Filter

If `focus=AREA` is set, filter to only show items related to that area. Match against:
- Issue labels
- Issue title/body keywords
- File paths (e.g., `focus=testing` matches test files)
- TODO context

### 3. Present Work Queue

Output the primary summary table, then detail sections for each source.

#### Primary Output — Work Queue Table

```markdown
## What's Next for ${REPO_NAME}

**Sources scanned:** GitHub issues, open PRs, roadmap files, audit outputs, codebase TODOs
**Found:** ${TOTAL_ITEMS} actionable items across ${SOURCE_COUNT} sources

### Work Queue

| Priority | Source | Item | Why |
|----------|--------|------|-----|
| P0 | PR | #45 — Failing CI, changes requested | Review feedback unaddressed for 3 days |
| P0 | Issue | #12 — Login broken on Android | Bug, reported 2 days ago |
| P1 | Issue | #18 — Add retry logic to API | from-review, has acceptance criteria |
| P1 | PR | #38 — Draft PR stale 14 days | Needs decision: finish or close |
| P2 | Issue | #25 — Improve error messages | enhancement, milestone v1.2 |
| P2 | Roadmap | Add rate limiting | In ROADMAP.md, no issue yet |
| P3 | TODO | 5× FIXME in src/auth/ | Scattered workarounds for token refresh |
| P3 | Audit | Upgrade vulnerable deps | From project-audit, no issue created |
```

#### Detail Sections

After the summary table, provide detail sections only for sources that had findings:

**GitHub Issues** (if any):
```markdown
### Open Issues ({N} total, {M} ready, {K} blocked)

**Ready to work on:**
- #18 — Add retry logic to API (`from-review`, `enhancement`) — has 3 acceptance criteria
- #25 — Improve error messages (`enhancement`) — milestone v1.2

**Blocked / Needs input:**
- #30 — Choose auth provider (`needs-design`) — requires decision
- #35 — Blocked by #18 (`blocked`)

**Assigned (in progress):**
- #22 — Refactor auth module — assigned to @user
```

**Open PRs** (if any):
```markdown
### Open PRs Needing Attention ({N})

- **#45** — Fix login flow: Changes requested 3 days ago, CI failing
- **#38** — Add caching layer: Draft, no updates in 14 days
```

**Roadmap Items** (if any):
```markdown
### Roadmap Items Not Yet Tracked ({N})

Items from planning docs without corresponding GitHub issues:
- Add rate limiting (ROADMAP.md line 42)
- Implement offline mode (ROADMAP.md line 58)
```

**Codebase TODOs** (if any):
```markdown
### Codebase TODOs ({N} markers across {M} files)

| Marker | Count | Top Locations |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| TODO | 12 | deploy.sh (5), sync.sh (4), docs/ (3) |
| FIXME | 3 | deploy.sh (2), generic/template.md (1) |
| HACK | 1 | sync.sh:42 |
```

#### Recommended Next Action

End with a concrete recommendation:

```markdown
### Recommended Next Action

Based on the work queue:
- **If you want to fix what's broken:** Address P0 items first — {description}
- **If you want to build features:** Run `/autonomous-dev-flow {issue_numbers}` for the P1/P2 ready issues
- **If you want to clean up:** The {N} TODOs in deploy.sh suggest a refactoring pass
```

### 4. Quick Audit (Fallback — Only If Queue Is Empty)

**ONLY run this phase if Phases 1-3 found zero actionable items.** If there were any issues, PRs, roadmap items, or TODOs, skip this phase entirely.

When the queue is truly empty, perform a lightweight codebase scan to surface potential investigations. This is NOT a full project audit — it's a quick check across a few dimensions.

#### 4a. Test Coverage Gaps

```bash
# Bash syntax check on deploy.sh and sync.sh
bash -n deploy.sh
bash -n sync.sh
```

- Check which source files have corresponding test or validation coverage
- Identify shell scripts that lack syntax validation
- Look for untested edge cases in deploy logic

#### 4b. Dependency Health

```bash
# Check for outdated dependencies in deploy.conf and workflow files
grep -E "^[A-Z_]+=" deploy.conf | head -20
```

- Review pinned versions in `deploy.conf`
- Check for deprecated GitHub Actions or shell utilities
- Verify self-hosted runner compatibility

#### 4c. Code Quality Signals

Quick scan for potential issues:
- Files over 500 lines (may need splitting)
- Functions/methods over 50 lines (may need refactoring)
- Deeply nested code (4+ levels of indentation)
- Duplicated patterns across files

#### 4d. Documentation Gaps

- README.md: is it up to date? Does it cover setup, usage, contributing?
- CLAUDE.md: are project conventions documented?
- `.claude/rules/`: are specialized rules (bash-compat, gh-actions) current?

#### 4e. Present Quick Audit Results

```markdown
## Quick Audit — Potential Investigations

No actionable items found in the standard work sources. Here's what a quick codebase scan revealed:

| Area | Status | Finding |
|------|--------|---------|
| Bash Syntax | ✅ | deploy.sh and sync.sh pass `-n` check |
| Dependencies | ⚠️ | {N} pinned versions in deploy.conf may be outdated |
| Code Quality | ⚠️ | {N} files over 500 lines |
| Documentation | ⚠️ | {N} `.claude/rules/` files need refresh |

### Suggested Investigations

1. **Audit deploy.conf versions** — Review pinned versions against latest releases. Effort: S
2. **Split {file}** — {file} is {N} lines. Consider extracting {concept}. Effort: S
3. **Refresh `.claude/rules/`** — {N} rules files may be stale. Effort: S

### Want a Deep Audit?

Run `/project-audit` for a comprehensive multi-agent analysis with detailed recommendations.
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Read-only** — This skill NEVER writes files, creates issues, creates PRs, or commits. It is purely informational. The user decides what to act on.
2. **Quick, not deep** — Phase 1-3 should complete in under 2 minutes. The fallback audit (Phase 4) adds 1-2 minutes. This is NOT `/project-audit`.
3. **Prioritize actionability** — Items with clear acceptance criteria and "ready" signals rank above vague ideas. The user should be able to pick the top item and start working immediately.
4. **Deduplicate across sources** — Never show the same work item from multiple sources. Link them instead.
5. **Graceful degradation** — If a source is unavailable (no `gh` auth, no roadmap file, no audit reports), skip it silently and note it in the sources summary. Never fail on a missing source.
6. **Respect blocked/assigned** — Show blocked and assigned items for context but clearly separate them from the actionable queue. Never recommend working on a blocked or assigned item.
7. **Composable output** — The "Recommended Next Action" section should include copy-pasteable commands (e.g., `/autonomous-dev-flow #12 #18 #25`) so the user can immediately act on the findings.
8. **No file writes** — The fallback audit in Phase 4 outputs to the conversation only. Unlike `/project-audit`, it does NOT write report files or create a `docs/` directory.
