# /agent-review

Launch an expert code reviewer agent with full project context.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - PR number (optional, defaults to current branch's PR)

## Instructions

### 1. Gather Context

Before reviewing, the agent MUST read:

```bash
# Project guidelines
cat CLAUDE.md

# Get PR info
PR_NUM=${1:-$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)}
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
gh pr view ${PR_NUM}
gh pr diff ${PR_NUM}
```

### 2. Review Criteria

The agent reviews against these standards:

#### Code Quality
{{CUSTOMIZE: Add repo-specific code quality criteria}}
- [ ] Follows project style guide (per CLAUDE.md)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No obvious security issues (injection, path traversal, credential exposure)
- [ ] Clean naming and structure

#### Architecture Alignment
{{CUSTOMIZE: Add repo-specific architecture criteria}}
- [ ] Changes follow established patterns
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing interfaces/APIs
- [ ] New patterns documented if introduced

#### Testing
{{CUSTOMIZE: Add repo-specific test criteria}}
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] New functionality has test coverage where appropriate
- [ ] No test regressions

#### Performance
- [ ] No obvious N-squared loops on collections
- [ ] No unbounded buffers or memory leaks
- [ ] Proper cleanup of resources (timers, listeners, processes, connections)

### 3. Generate Review

Create a comprehensive review:

```markdown
## Code Review: PR #${PR_NUM}

### Summary
Brief overview of changes and their purpose.

### Strengths
- What's done well
- Good patterns used

### Issues Found

#### Critical (Must Fix)
| File | Line | Issue | Suggested Fix |
|------|------|-------|---------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

#### Suggestions (Should Consider)
| File | Line | Suggestion | Rationale |
|------|------|------------|-----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

#### Nitpicks (Optional)
- Minor style/formatting notes

### Deferred Items (Follow-Up Issues)

| Suggestion | Issue | Rationale for deferral |
|------------|-------|------------------------|
| ... | #XX | ... |

### Architecture Notes
How this change fits within the project architecture.

### Verdict
- [ ] Approve - Ready to merge
- [ ] Request Changes - Issues must be addressed
- [ ] Comment - Feedback only, author decides
```

### 4. Post Review on PR

Post review as a PR comment using heredoc:

```bash
gh pr comment ${PR_NUM} --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Code Review: PR #XX

[Your review content here]
EOF
)"
```

### 5. Create Follow-Up Issues for Deferred Items

**MANDATORY: For any suggestion or nitpick that is valid but out of scope, create a tracked GitHub issue.**

Never leave deferred items as just review comments. If it's worth mentioning, it's worth tracking.

```bash
# {{CUSTOMIZE: Add repo-specific labels}}
ISSUE_URL=$(gh issue create \
  --title "Short descriptive title" \
  --label "enhancement" \
  --label "from-review" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Context

Identified during review of PR #${PR_NUM}.

## Description

What needs to be done and why.

## Original Review Comment

> Quote the review finding here

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
EOF
)")
```

Include created issue URLs in the review summary table.

### 6. Reconcile Issues Resolved in This PR

After all fixes are committed, check whether any issues created during this review — or pre-existing `from-review` issues — were already addressed by fixes in this PR.

```bash
# List open from-review issues
gh issue list --label "from-review" --json number,title,body

# For each issue resolved by a fix in this PR:
gh issue comment ${ISSUE_NUM} --body "Addressed in PR #${PR_NUM} — ${DESCRIPTION}."
gh issue close ${ISSUE_NUM}
```

**RULE: Every closed issue MUST reference a PR.** The comment is the paper trail. No silent closes.

### 7. Report to User

Output:
- Review verdict
- Critical issues count
- Suggestions count
- Follow-up issues created (with URLs)
- Issues closed as already resolved (with URLs)
- Link to posted review

## Agent Persona

{{CUSTOMIZE: Define repo-specific reviewer persona}}

You are an expert code reviewer with deep knowledge of the project's tech stack. You review with the mindset of reliability, maintainability, and correctness.

## Review Philosophy

1. **Be constructive** - Suggest fixes, not just problems
2. **Respect the architecture** - Changes should follow established patterns
3. **Pragmatic over perfect** - Working code first, polish later
4. **Reliability first** - Always consider error recovery and edge cases
5. **Keep it simple** - No over-engineering, no premature abstractions

## Customization Points

Lines marked with `{{CUSTOMIZE}}` need repo-specific adaptation:
- Review persona (name, expertise areas, mindset quote)
- Code quality criteria (language-specific, framework-specific)
- Architecture criteria (project-specific patterns)
- Testing criteria (test framework, CI requirements)
- Issue labels (repo-specific label system)
