# /prime-directive

A reload-resilient directive for unattended work toward a delegated outcome, or an explicitly requested backlog-clearing marathon. Re-invoke it after every context compaction to restore the mission, acceptance criteria, authority, per-issue loop, and never-strip guardrails before resuming. `/tackle-issues` and `/autonomous-dev-flow` provide the wave machinery.

Invoke it at the **start** of an unattended run to set the mission, and again **after every compaction** to reload it. It does not start work by itself — it re-grounds the agent, then hands off to the marathon machinery (`/tackle-issues`) for the actual wave loop. Treat this file as load-bearing: everything an interrupted, freshly-compacted agent needs to safely resume is here, in one read. Natural-language cues like *"work autonomously / use the prime directive / keep going until the backlog is clean or you're genuinely blocked"* should route here.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — all optional:
  - *(empty)* — reload the directive as written: re-establish mission + guardrails, read the session log for live state, resume the marathon.
  - A path — override the session-log location for this run (default below).
  - A short mission override in quotes — narrow the scope for this run (e.g. `"only label:ready-to-build"`), without editing the file.

## Reliability — the reload contract (read this first)

This skill exists because a long autonomous run is **compacted repeatedly**, and each compaction summarizes (and can quietly distort) the agent's memory of *what it is doing and what the rules are*. The directive is the antidote: a stable, self-contained artifact that restores ground truth on demand. Four rules make that reliable — do not weaken them:

1. **Reload by invocation, never by file-path `cat`.** After every compaction, run **`/prime-directive`**. Do **not** rely on `cat .claude/commands/<name>.md` or any hard-coded path: the legacy `.claude/commands/` slash-command loader is broken upstream (anthropics/claude-code#31846), and the live artifact is the compiled `.claude/skills/prime-directive/SKILL.md` that `/prime-directive` loads. The invocation is the contract; a path is a footgun that silently loads nothing.

2. **Plant the reload trigger where a compacted agent will see it.** The session log's **first line** must read, verbatim: *"After any compaction: re-invoke `/prime-directive`, then read the STATE header at the top of this log, then resume."* Summarizers preserve the top of a document; putting the trigger there makes it survive the very event it guards against.

   **The STATE header is the only mandatory post-compaction read.** Directly under that first line, maintain a rolling **STATE header** — a compact block (~2K tokens, hard-capped) that is rewritten in place as the run progresses, holding: delegated outcome + observable acceptance, current usable state + remaining gap, authority and cumulative run limits, current wave + position, queue pointer (next issue up, remaining count), open blockers, the awaiting-user list, the last **verified** merge (PR + SHA), completions from the last wave, and a compact per-issue attempt table (issue# → attempts, last strategy tried, status) — the fields a wave-boundary convergence check needs without a history re-read. Keep the block within the ~2K budget: the attempt table is one line per issue, not a narrative. Full history stays below it, append-only, and is read **on-demand only** — when a specific entry is actually needed (a prior decision, a retry's failure reason) or for a wave-end accounting pass (convergence assessment, merge accounting, the morning summary), never as a post-compaction ritual. Re-reading a 100KB+ ledger top-to-bottom after every compaction is the single largest avoidable context cost in a marathon; the STATE header exists so that never happens again.

   Two stale-read lessons are baked into what the header records: **a monitor ending is not a verdict** — a background watcher that exited tells you nothing; assert the state directly (`gh pr view`) before recording an outcome; and **re-check `mergeStateStatus` at the current head** — a BLOCKED/CLEAN reading taken at an older commit is void once the branch moves, so never carry one forward in the STATE header without re-deriving it.

3. **Keep this file self-contained.** Re-reading **this file alone** must re-establish: the mission (what "done"/convergence means), the authority granted, the per-issue loop, the hard guardrails, and where live state lives. Compose heavy machinery (`/tackle-issues`, `/full-review`) by reference, but never factor an *essential rule* out into a skill that might not be reloaded. The constitution stands alone; the machinery is called by name.

4. **Re-entry is idempotent.** Resuming mid-run must never duplicate work. Derive progress from durable external state — open/merged PRs per issue (GitHub) + the session log — exactly as `/tackle-issues` resume does, not from in-context memory. Re-invoking `/prime-directive` at any moment is always safe.

## Mission

Advance the user's delegated outcome for {{CUSTOMIZE: target repository, e.g. `owner/name` — the repo this run owns}}. Record the outcome in the user's terms, the observable acceptance criteria, and the current usable state before selecting work. Prioritize what closes that gap; issue closure is evidence of work, not proof of delivery. Use **backlog-clear mode** only when the user explicitly requests it: its scope is the selected backlog, with convergence when everything is resolved or genuinely documented-blocked. Decomposition does not complete its sub-issues or the product outcome.

Continue within the authorized scope until acceptance is demonstrated, remaining work genuinely requires user QA/access/authority, the configured retry or budget limit is reached, or the host cannot continue. A local blocker does not stop independent authorized work. Do **not** stop early for routine confirmation: decide reversible implementation choices, record them, and proceed. Keep owner-reserved decisions and safety gates intact.

Before marking an item blocked, check for an authorized fallback. If verification shows it preserves safety, correctness, required runtime and cost constraints, and the essential capability, use it, file the underlying problem, and continue without an owner pause. Otherwise document the specific dependency and evidence, block only that item, and advance independent work. **Never fake-merge a blocked issue as done**, or call a reduced capability equivalent without evidence.

## Authority

For an unattended run, this directive grants: full autonomous **self-merge under the merge gate below**; create / close / comment / label issues; decompose epics into sub-issues; file follow-up issues for deferred work; and use a decision panel ({{CUSTOMIZE: decision mechanism — e.g. `/swarm-audit`, or a decision sub-agent panel}}) to choose among genuine options and then **act on the recommendation** rather than escalating to the user.

{{CUSTOMIZE: Tighten or widen this grant to match what the repo owner has actually approved for unattended runs. If self-merge is NOT authorized for this repo, state that PRs accumulate for human review (or for `/batch-merge`) and the gate's final step stops at "ready to merge".}}

## Per-issue loop (self-contained — run for every issue, every wave)

1. **Sync** — `git checkout main && git pull origin main`. Always branch fresh from main; never stack branches.
2. **Understand** — read the issue + linked threads. {{CUSTOMIZE: code-intelligence shortcut — if the repo has a code-intel MCP (e.g. repo-memory: `get_file_summary` / `search_by_purpose`), use it before Read/grep to save tokens; otherwise grep/Read.}} Re-verify any stored audit/plan claim against current main — audits go stale as main moves.
3. **Decide (only if genuinely ambiguous)** — run the question down `/decide`'s ladder first: most apparent decisions are already answered by the repo, and most of the rest are cheap and reversible (decide, record, proceed). For what survives that — a real decision within delegated authority — run the decision panel ({{CUSTOMIZE: `/swarm-audit` or equivalent}}), **pick the recommended option**, and **record the decision** in the session log plus a one-line note on the issue. Escalate only decisions actually reserved to the owner; continue independent work while awaiting them.
4. **Implement (TDD)** — branch {{CUSTOMIZE: branch naming convention, e.g. `feat|fix|refactor|test/<slug>`}}, record it as `SESSION_BRANCH`, re-assert it against `git branch --show-current` before the first edit (and again before staging, step 5), then RED → GREEN → REFACTOR. Match house style: {{CUSTOMIZE: house code style, e.g. "server: ES modules, no semicolons, single quotes, no TypeScript"}}. Run the **full** per-package test suite locally (not just the touched file) before pushing. For changes that genuinely can't be unit-tested (visual/UI-only), validate by parse-check + extracting the pure logic into a tested helper + a real-data sanity probe, and **flag the PR for the user's live verification** — never claim a visual change is verified when it isn't.
5. **Stage + PR** — re-assert `SESSION_BRANCH`, `git status --short`, stage the changed files **by name** (never `-A` / `.` / `-u` / a bare directory), commit, push, open a PR. Link the issue with a closing keyword: `Closes #N`. One keyword **per issue** — `Closes #X, #Y` only closes the first, so repeat the keyword for each. Avoid negated phrasings ("does NOT close #N" still auto-closes).
6. **Full review (MANDATORY)** — run `/full-review`. A sub-agent review is mandatory on **every** PR (read-only: `gh pr diff` / `git show <ref>:<path>`; a non-worktree review agent must **never** `git checkout`). {{CUSTOMIZE: third-party review — e.g. Copilot is best-effort: if it is blocked / quota-exhausted / not arriving, skip it and do not stall.}} Triage every thread.
7. **Resolve + follow-ups** — examine inline findings and general review summaries. Fix defects introduced or worsened by this PR, including missing promised acceptance behavior, before merge; alternatively remove the defective change or contain it with a verified fallback meeting the Mission's conditions. An issue URL or a >15-minute estimate is not a fix. File pre-existing unrelated defects and optional improvements as follow-ups. After each supported disposition, reply and resolve its thread; all threads must be resolved before merge.
8. **Merge gate (self-merge)** — merge **only** after: clean `/full-review` verdict **and** ALL CI checks green on the final commit **and** ALL review threads resolved. Then **synchronous squash merge**; confirm the PR reports `MERGED`. **NEVER** `gh pr merge --auto`, `--admin`, or any protection override. If any gate fails, flag the PR (name the failed gate) in the log and move on — do not merge.
9. **Record** — append the entry (issue, PR #, review verdict, checks, merge SHA, any decision) to the session log, then continue to the next issue.

## Waves / queue

- **Prioritize** the next observable acceptance criterion and its necessary prerequisites. Decompose large features into bounded increments. Review-generated cleanup does not outrank the outcome merely because it is easy; in explicit backlog-clear mode, order the selected backlog by value and dependencies.
- **Replenish** only with work needed for that outcome or matching the explicitly selected backlog. Escalate retries: fresh context → alternative approach → verified fallback or bounded scope → documented-blocked comment. Scope reduction must retain the agreed acceptance criteria.
- **Converge:** zero new completions triggers reassessment of evidence, strategy and dependencies, not an automatic stop. Continue a concrete remaining approach within `/tackle-issues`' attempt/wave and budget caps; do not reset those caps at a session boundary. Stop an exhausted item and continue independent authorized work; report the actual reason when the run cannot advance.

## Session boundaries (context + cost discipline)

A marathon uses **bounded sessions** while preserving the delegated outcome across them. Account for context reads and handoff/reconstruction overhead together; do not assume a restart saves tokens without measurements. Three rules, checked at every wave boundary:

1. **Shed context at every wave boundary — how depends on the run mode.** When a wave completes, write/refresh the handoff note, update the STATE header, then apply the case that matches this run:
   - **Owner requested a pause or attended restart** — end with the verified seed path and the exact remaining work.
   - **Authorized re-launcher available** — submit the handoff + queue + STATE header and verify the orchestrator accepted the next run before ending. Record its task/session identifier; configured is not the same as accepted. ({{CUSTOMIZE: wave re-launcher — e.g. chroxy controller, cron/launchd job, /loop wrapper; leave "none" if absent}})
   - **No accepted re-launch** — continue in the current run using supported host continuation/compaction where available. Do not invent a compaction command or claim that writing a seed scheduled anything. If the host cannot continue, report that capability limit and the restart needed, without mislabeling it a product decision.
   A user watching an app does not itself request a pause. The seed preserves state; the accepted next run or continuing host supplies execution. Compare restart costs including the handoff and reconstruction before claiming savings.
2. **Shed at a wave boundary, never against an invented token number.** There is no numeric in-wave context ceiling: a healthy wave legitimately crosses 150K mid-flight (the global Session-boundaries doctrine retired the number 2026-08-19 for exactly that reason), so the levers are structural — arrange continuation at the wave boundary per rule 1, and route heavy tool output (full-file reads, test logs, recon dumps) through subagents so it never rides the main thread. If a single item refuses to converge and balloons the wave, that is a scope problem, not a token problem: finish or park the item, write the handoff, and end the wave early. A wave ending does not itself end the delegated run; continue under rule 1.
3. **Per-wave cost circuit breaker.** At each wave boundary, check measured cost against the configured limit and its scope ({{CUSTOMIZE: cost source and owner-set budget, including whether it is per wave, session or run}}). Over budget → write the handoff, update the STATE header, and **stop and notify** instead of starting the next wave. Carry run limits across restarts. Missing measurements are unknown, not zero; do not invent a budget or a claim of savings.

A mid-wave compaction is a fallback for context pressure. At a wave boundary, prefer an accepted re-launch or supported host context management. If neither exists, continue while the host permits it and report any actual capability limit honestly.

## Final step (when the outcome or selected backlog is complete)

Verify the agreed acceptance criteria and report the usable result, its evidence and remaining limits. Run a whole-project audit only if requested or necessary to establish those criteria; completion does not automatically generate a new cleanup backlog.

## Hard guardrails

### Universal — never strip (these are guarded)

- **Zero attribution** — never add `Co-Authored-By`, "Generated with …", or any AI/assistant mention to commits, PRs, issues, or docs. The user is the sole author.
- **Never commit to main** — feature branch + PR, always.
- **Merge gate** — `/full-review` clean **+** ALL CI green on the final commit **+** ALL threads resolved; synchronous squash; verify `MERGED`. **No** `--auto`, **no** `--admin`, **no** protection overrides.
- **Explicit-path staging** — `git status --short` first, then `git add` the files you changed, **by name**. Never `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git add -u`, `git add <dir>/`, or `git commit -a`. The working copy is shared with concurrent sessions, so a bulk add commits whatever else happens to be in the tree. `-u` is not the safe one: it restages every *tracked* file whose worktree copy differs, including files a clean/smudge filter rewrote without you touching them — that is how `git add -u` turned a tracked 21KB `.docx` into a git-lfs pointer and committed it as an edit.
- **Assert the branch before you write** — record the branch you created as `SESSION_BRANCH`, then re-check it against `git branch --show-current` immediately before your first edit **and again immediately before staging**. Git's HEAD is global to the working copy, so a concurrent session can move it after you branched and a checkout from ten minutes ago proves nothing. If HEAD is not `SESSION_BRANCH`, stop — do not edit, do not stage — and re-establish the branch first.
- **Report** — use the global `**Status:**` block and `**Next:**` line. At a session boundary state the delegated outcome, what is usable today, the remaining gap, and the actual execution state: continuing/accepted next run, ready for user QA, budget/retry limit, specific blocker, host continuation limit, or complete. Name a user action only when it is genuinely needed. At the end of a long run, also produce an executive brief {{CUSTOMIZE: brief mechanism + destination — e.g. the `visual-brief` skill into `$CLAUDE_BRIEF_DIR`}}. Lead with usable outcomes and acceptance evidence, with PR/check detail below.

### Project-specific — build-breaking invariants (CUSTOMIZE)

{{CUSTOMIZE: List the repo's load-bearing invariants whose violation silently breaks CI or corrupts state — the things a fresh agent would not infer from the diff. Keep each to one line. Example set (Chroxy):
- **Node 22** — `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin:$PATH"` for all server/node commands.
- **Tests + state** — every `new SessionManager(...)` in tests passes a temp `stateFilePath`; run the full per-package suite locally; server custom lints (`packages/server/scripts/lint-*.sh`) — eslint-green ≠ Server Lint green.
- **Opt forwarding** — a new `BaseSession` opt goes in the ctor destructure AND `BASE_SESSION_OPT_KEYS` in the same PR.
- **Protocol dist** — after a `packages/protocol/src/schemas` change: `npm run build -w packages/protocol`, then `git add -f packages/protocol/dist/<each built file>` (the dist is gitignored, so the force flag is needed — name the files; `-u` would restage unrelated tracked churn).
- **Control-char regexes** — never author `\uXXXX` control-char regexes via Edit/Write (writes literal bytes); use a node script + verify with `cat -v`.
- **Review agents** — isolate or forbid `git checkout`/`switch`/`stash`; re-assert the feature branch after any concurrent worktree agent.
- **Merge ruleset** — main requires a third-party review (Copilot) + resolved threads on every PR; BLOCKED-with-green-CI usually means an unreviewed/unresolved thread, not a flake.
}}

## State / where things live

- **Session log + decision log:** {{CUSTOMIZE: session-log path, e.g. `autonomous-session-<date>.md` at repo root — gitignored, never commit}}. Source of truth for progress + decisions to present on interrupt. Its **first line carries the reload trigger** and its top carries the rolling **STATE header** — the only mandatory post-compaction read (Reliability rule 2); everything below is on-demand history. Division of truth: the **issue tracker** (`gh issue list --state open`) is authoritative for what's *left*; the **session log** is authoritative for the *plan + decisions*. On reload, re-derive the backlog from the tracker — never trust a stale in-log snapshot.
- **Wave handoff seed:** `$CLAUDE_HANDOFF_DIR/NEXT-<scope>.md` (default dir `~/Obsidian/no-it-all/handoffs/`), written by `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/session-seed.py write --picks-up-at "<the next thing>"` and by nothing else. Carry the delegated outcome, observable acceptance, usable state, remaining gap, actual continuation/QA/budget/block status, real user action if any, authority and cumulative limits, plus queue position and the last verified merge. Re-derive issue/PR state from GitHub; preserve user intent and decisions that GitHub cannot reconstruct. The seed is a handoff, not proof that another run started. Two conditions make it real, and the script is what holds both:
  - **It is written outside every worktree**, at that absolute path — never inside the wave's own tree, where `git worktree remove --force` deletes untracked files silently. Nothing to commit, nothing to push, nothing to gate teardown on; the relaunch task names the same path at every boundary, and the command prints it as `seed: <path>`.
  - **It carries `/session-lifecycle`'s End-step-1 frontmatter** — `type`, `date` (full UTC timestamp), `scope`, `session`, `picks_up_at`, `sensitivity` — and it **archives rather than overwrites**: an existing seed carrying a different `session:` is renamed to `NEXT-<scope>.<UTC>-<sid>.md` before this one is written. A REFUSE never destroys the incumbent — a failed archive aborts before the write — but it does not mean nothing happened: the write ends by proving itself, so a REFUSE from the proof arrives after the seed is on disk. Read the `archived:` and `seed:` lines, not the exit code alone. **Do not hand-write the seed** at a wave boundary: the script is the only implementation, and a wave that rolls its own is the drift this consolidated away.
- **Queue:** {{CUSTOMIZE: queue path — default `scratchpad/autonomous-queue.json`}}. The durable wave queue the next session is seeded from.
- **This directive:** invoke `/prime-directive` (compiled live artifact: `.claude/skills/prime-directive/SKILL.md`). Do not depend on the `.claude/commands/` path resolving (Reliability rule 1).
- **Issue list:** `gh issue list --state open`.

## Customization Points

Lines and blocks marked `{{CUSTOMIZE}}` need repo-specific adaptation:

- **Target repository** — `owner/name` the marathon owns (Mission).
- **Authority grant** — tighten/widen to what the owner approved; whether self-merge is authorized (Authority + step 8).
- **Decision mechanism** — `/swarm-audit` or a decision sub-agent panel (step 3, Authority).
- **Code-intelligence shortcut** — code-intel MCP (e.g. repo-memory) or plain grep/Read (step 2).
- **Branch naming convention** — e.g. `feat|fix|refactor|test/<slug>` (step 4).
- **House code style** — language/format rules (step 4).
- **Third-party review** — e.g. Copilot best-effort handling (step 6).
- **Executive-brief mechanism + destination** — e.g. `visual-brief` → `$CLAUDE_BRIEF_DIR` (Report guardrail).
- **Project-specific build-breaking invariants** — the repo's never-strip CI/state invariants (Hard guardrails).
- **Session-log path** — the gitignored progress/decision log (State).
- **Queue path** — where the durable wave queue lives, default `scratchpad/autonomous-queue.json` (State).
- **Wave re-launcher** — what restarts the next wave in unattended runs (scheduled trigger, cron/launchd job, /loop wrapper), or "none" (Session boundaries).
- **Cost source + per-session budget** — where session cost is read (e.g. the statusline) and the budget the circuit breaker enforces (Session boundaries).
