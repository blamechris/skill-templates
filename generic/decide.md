# /decide

A decision protocol for an agent that thinks it is blocked. Most apparent blocks are not blocks: they are questions the repo already answers, or cheap reversible calls the agent is entitled to make and record. The few that are real deserve a structured question carrying options and a recommendation — not a paragraph of prose that hands the problem back and waits. This skill routes any pending decision down a fixed ladder, and dictates the shape of the ask when escalation is genuinely warranted.

Invoke it the moment you catch yourself about to write *"I need your input"*, *"how would you like me to proceed"*, or *"let me know and I'll continue"* — and any time you are about to stop work pending an answer. Cues like *"just decide"*, *"stop stalling"*, *"ask me properly"*, *"what are my options"* route here too. There are exactly two acceptable outcomes: a decision you made and recorded, or one `AskUserQuestion` call carrying 2-4 options with your recommendation first. A paragraph ending in a question mark is not one of them.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` — all optional:
  - *(empty)* — run the decision currently in front of you down the ladder.
  - A question in quotes — run that one question down the ladder.
  - `batch` — sweep every question accumulated so far, drop the ones rungs 1-2 answer, and escalate the survivors together in a single round.

## The ladder

Run the rungs **in order**, and stop at the first one that resolves the question. A question reaches the user only by surviving rungs 1 and 2 — that ordering is the whole mechanism, and jumping straight to "ask" is the failure this skill exists to prevent.

### 1. Answer it yourself from the repo

Most questions that feel like they need the user are already answered by artifacts you can read. Search before you escalate:

- **The code around it** — how do the ten nearest files do this? Convention beats preference.
- **Git history** — `git log -S'<symbol>'`, `git log --oneline -- <path>`, `git blame`. The last person to touch this usually left their reasoning in a commit body.
- **The issue and its thread** — acceptance criteria settle scope questions; comments settle design ones.
- **Docs, ADRs, `CLAUDE.md`** — {{CUSTOMIZE: this repo's sources of truth for design decisions — e.g. `docs/adr/`, `docs/architecture.md`, a code-intel MCP like repo-memory (`search_by_purpose`), the issue tracker command}}.
- **The tests** — they encode intended behaviour more precisely than any doc.
- **This session** — was it already settled upstream, earlier in the run, or in the session log? Re-asking a settled question is worse than not asking.

Questions that look like user decisions and are not:

- *"Which naming convention?"* — the sibling files already chose it.
- *"New module, or extend the existing one?"* — the architecture doc and the way the siblings are split.
- *"Which error type / log level?"* — grep the neighbours.
- *"Should I write a test for this?"* — repo policy. Yes.
- *"Which library?"* — the one already in the dependency manifest.
- *"Keep backwards compatibility for X?"* — count X's callers first; zero callers is not a compatibility question.
- *"Is this in scope for the issue?"* — the acceptance criteria say.
- *"Should I fix the failing lint too?"* — CI has to be green. Not a choice.
- *"Which version number?"* — the versioning scheme and the changelog.

If reading gives you a defensible answer, that is your answer. Cite where you found it (file, commit, issue comment) so the reasoning survives you.

### 2. Decide and record

If the call is cheap and reversible, it is yours to make. The test: **could you undo it in a minute, with a follow-up commit, before anything outside this branch depends on it?** If yes, decide.

- **Pick** the option you would defend.
- **State the assumption** in plain words — "assumed X because Y".
- **Write it down** where the work carries it: {{CUSTOMIZE: decision-record destination — e.g. the commit body, an "Assumptions" section in the PR body, a comment on the issue, the session log, or an ADR for anything architectural}}.
- **Proceed.** Do not stop for confirmation on something you could undo in a minute.

Recording is not paperwork — it is what keeps the decision cheap to overturn. A recorded assumption costs the user one line to reverse; an unrecorded one costs them an archaeology session. And a decision nobody wrote down gets made again, differently, three files later.

Typically this rung: internal naming, file layout, test structure, error-message wording, how far a refactor spreads inside the diff you are already writing, which of two already-vendored helpers to use, a default behind a flag that ships off.

Silence is consent at this rung — that is precisely why it is this rung, and precisely why silence is never consent at rung 3.

### 3. Escalate only when it materially changes the work

Escalate only if at least one of these is true:

- **Divergent deliverable** — the answers lead to genuinely different work, and picking wrong wastes hours rather than minutes.
- **Irreversible** — deleted data, a force-push, a published release or package, a closed account, a sent message. You cannot take it back.
- **Outward-facing** — someone beyond this branch sees it: a public API, schema or CLI surface you would then have to deprecate; a message to a human; an issue or PR on a repo that is not yours; published docs.
- **Spends the user's money, quota or reputation** — paid API calls, provisioned infrastructure, anything published under their name.
- **Overrides something they already said** — you would be carving an exception out of a stated preference. Ask; do not assume the exception.
- **Legal, security or privacy weight** — credentials, licences, personal data.

None of those? Go back down to rung 2 and decide. Asking is not free: it costs the user a context switch and it costs the run its momentum. Weigh that against the cost of being wrong — and remember that a wrong rung-2 call is usually a one-commit fix.

{{CUSTOMIZE: unattended-run override — under an autonomous authority grant (e.g. `/prime-directive`), rung 3 collapses into rung 2: decide, record, proceed, never block on the user. Name the exceptions the owner still reserves — typically the irreversible, outward-facing and money-spending bullets above.}}

### 4. When you escalate, escalate well

Use the **`AskUserQuestion` tool. Never prose.** A question buried in a paragraph makes the user reconstruct your context, compose an answer, and remember what they already told you; a structured question is answered with a click.

- **2-4 concrete options.** Each names an actual course of action ("ship the SQLite backend now, add Postgres behind an adapter later"), not a category ("the simple approach").
- **Lead with your recommendation.** The first option is the one you would take, and it is labelled as the recommendation. You built the context; carrying that judgment back with the question is the deliverable, not an overstep.
- **Real pros and cons on every option — including the recommended one.** Name what your recommendation costs. An option with no downside listed reads as unconsidered, and a judgment whose price is hidden cannot be audited.
- **Plain language.** Write for someone who has not read the diff: expand the internal names, drop the acronyms you coined this session, describe consequences in terms of the product rather than the code.
- **One round, not five.** Batch every open question. Drip-feeding one per turn turns a five-minute conversation into a day of latency.
- **Say what happens if they do not answer** — normally that you proceed on the recommendation once the unblocked work runs out. A question with no default is a stall with extra steps.
- **Never ask a bare "what would you like to do?"** If you cannot draft two concrete options, you do not understand the problem well enough to escalate it. Go back to rung 1.

{{CUSTOMIZE: fallback channel if `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable in the target agent — e.g. a single message with a numbered option list, the recommendation labelled and placed first, pros and cons per option, and the no-answer default. The shape is the requirement; the tool is the default carrier.}}

### 5. Never idle

**A block on one thread is not a block on the work.** Before you ask anything:

- **Split the work** into what actually depends on the answer and what does not. The dependent slice is almost always smaller than it feels.
- **Keep going on everything else** — the other items in the queue, the tests, the docs, the parts of this change that both answers share. {{CUSTOMIZE: where the parallel work comes from — e.g. `gh issue list --state open --label ready`, the current wave's queue, the review backlog}}.
- **If everything truly depends on the answer**, build the recommendation, marked provisional, while the question stays open. A provisional implementation is far easier to redirect than a blank branch.
- **Report progress alongside the question.** Never send a message whose entire content is a question. *"Asked about X; meanwhile Y and Z landed and CI is green"* is a report. *"I'm blocked on X"* is not.

## Anti-patterns

Every one of these has shipped. Name it when you catch yourself doing it.

- **The prose block** — *"I wasn't sure whether to use X or Y, so I stopped."* A block delivered as a paragraph, with no options and nothing to click, leaves the user guessing what you even want from them.
- **Full stop on a partial block** — one thread waiting, the whole run parked, while four other items were ready to go.
- **The drip-feed** — one question this turn, another the next, a third after that. Five interruptions for what was one conversation.
- **Re-litigating settled ground** — asking about something already decided earlier in this session, in the issue thread, or in an ADR. Read the log before you ask.
- **Optionless options** — a list of choices with no steer, so the user has to rebuild the context you already have before they can pick. If you cannot recommend, you have not finished thinking.
- **Escalating what the repo answers** — the most common failure of all, and the cheapest to avoid: the convention was sitting in the sibling file the whole time.
- **Manufactured urgency** — dressing a one-commit reversible choice as a fork in the road, and buying an interrupt with it.
- **Silence as approval** — proceeding with an irreversible or outward-facing action because nobody replied. No answer means not yet.

## Is this actually blocked?

Run this before every escalation. Every line must be **yes**; the first **no** names the rung to go back to.

1. I searched the code, the git history, the issue thread and the docs, and the answer is not there. *(No → rung 1.)*
2. It was not already decided earlier in this session, or in a previous one. *(No → rung 1.)*
3. The answers lead to genuinely different work — not just a different name, order, or internal shape. *(No → rung 2.)*
4. I cannot cheaply undo the wrong choice; or the action is irreversible, outward-facing, or spends the user's money or reputation. *(No → rung 2.)*
5. I can state 2-4 concrete options, and I know which one I would pick and why. *(No → rung 1 — you do not understand it well enough to ask yet.)*
6. I know what continues regardless of the answer, and it is already continuing. *(No → rung 5.)*

## Reporting

The question itself goes through the tool; the message around it still ends with the house `**Status:**` line — what is done, what is in flight, and what is waiting on the answer, naming the question. One to three lines, no padding. A status line whose whole content is "blocked" is the failure this skill exists to prevent. {{CUSTOMIZE: the repo's reporting convention if it differs from the `**Status:**` line — keep whatever names the open question and the work that continued}}.

## Customization Points

Lines marked `{{CUSTOMIZE}}` need repo-specific adaptation:

- **Sources of truth for rung 1** — where design answers actually live in this repo (ADR directory, architecture docs, code-intel MCP, issue tracker command).
- **Decision-record destination** — where a rung-2 decision gets written down (commit body, PR "Assumptions" section, issue comment, session log, ADR).
- **Unattended-run override** — whether an autonomous grant collapses rung 3 into rung 2, and which escalation triggers the owner still reserves.
- **Fallback escalation channel** — the shape to use when the target agent has no `AskUserQuestion` tool.
- **Parallel work source** — what the agent picks up while a question is open (issue query, wave queue, review backlog).
- **Reporting convention** — the repo's end-of-message status format, if not the house `**Status:**` line.
