# /autonomous-dev-flow

Orchestrate long-running autonomous dev sessions — work through GitHub issues sequentially with TDD, create PRs, run /full-review, then merge or flag according to this repo's self-merge posture, and continue to the next issue. PRs that don't merge accumulate for asynchronous user review while work continues.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Issue source and options. Examples:
  - `label:ready-to-build` (all open issues with this label)
  - `milestone:"v1.2"` (all open issues in milestone)
  - `#12 #15 #18` or `12 15 18` (specific issues by number)
  - `label:ready-to-build max:5 sort:created-asc` (with options)
  - If empty, auto-detect: scan open issues sorted by complexity (low first, then medium, skip high)
  - Options: `max:N` (default 10, hard cap 15), `sort:created-asc` (default) or `sort:created-desc`

## Instructions

### Phase 0: Queue Setup

```bash
# {{CUSTOMIZE: Branch prefix for autonomous session branches — e.g., "auto/" or multiple prefixes for repos that use feat/, fix/, etc.}}
BRANCH_PREFIX="auto/"
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to determine the issue source:

- **Explicit list**: Strip `#` prefixes, run `gh issue view ${NUM} --json number,title,state,labels,body,assignees` for each
- **Label**: `gh issue list --label "${LABEL}" --state open --json number,title,labels,assignees --limit ${MAX}`
- **Milestone**: `gh issue list --milestone "${MILESTONE}" --state open --json number,title,labels,assignees --limit ${MAX}`
- **Auto-detect** (empty args): `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,labels,assignees --limit 30` then sort by complexity label (low first, then medium, skip high)

Apply sort order and cap to `max` (hard cap 15 — sessions beyond this rarely maintain quality). Recommended: 3-5 issues for first use; sessions of 10+ work best with well-specified, low-complexity issues.

**Filter out assigned issues** — exclude issues with assignees from the working queue. Show them in the queue table as informational but don't process them.

**Validate the queue before starting:**
- At least 1 issue must be open and unassigned
- If all matching issues are assigned, report "All N matching issues are assigned — nothing to process" and stop
- If 0 issues match, report and stop — don't start an empty session
- Show the user the queue and get confirmation before entering the loop

```markdown
## Work Queue ({N} issues, {M} skipped as assigned)

| # | Issue | Labels | Action |
|---|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | #12 — Add retry logic to API client | enhancement | Implement |
| 2 | #15 — Add leaderboard system | complexity:high | Decompose → sub-issues |
| — | #16 — Refactor auth module | enhancement | Assigned to @user (skipped) |
| 3 | #18 — Add integration tests for auth flow | testing | Implement |

Start autonomous dev session?
```

Wait for user confirmation. **This is the ONLY confirmation point** — everything after runs autonomously.

After confirmation, create task list tracking:
```
For each issue in work queue:
  TaskCreate: "Issue #N — <title>" with status pending
```

### Phase 0.5: Auto-Decompose High-Complexity Issues

When the queue contains issues that are too large to implement directly (e.g., labeled {{CUSTOMIZE: Decomposition trigger label — e.g., `complexity:high`}} or equivalent), decompose them into smaller, independently implementable sub-issues BEFORE entering the core loop.

For each high-complexity issue:

0. Check for prior decomposition — scan the issue's comments for an existing "Decomposed into #A, #B, #C" comment. If found, use those existing sub-issues instead of creating new ones.
1. Read the full issue body: `gh issue view ${ISSUE_NUM} --json body,comments -q .`
2. Understand the full scope — files involved, systems affected, testing needs
3. Break into 2-5 sub-issues, each low or medium complexity
4. Create sub-issues via `gh issue create`:

```bash
SUB_URL=$(gh issue create \
  --title "type(scope): Sub-task description" \
  --label "enhancement" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

Specific sub-task description.

Part of #${ISSUE_NUM}

## Implementation Plan

- Files to modify: `src/path/to/file`
- Test strategy: Add tests for X behavior
- Approach: [specific implementation details]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
EOF
)")

SUB_NUM=$(basename "$SUB_URL")
```

5. Insert sub-issues at FRONT of queue (context is fresh from reading the parent)
6. Comment on parent issue: `gh issue comment ${ISSUE_NUM} --body "Decomposed into #A, #B, #C — each independently implementable with TDD."`
7. Parent stays open until all sub-issues merge — do NOT close it
8. After decomposition, if the total queue exceeds 15, truncate to 15 with a message: "Queue expanded to N issues after decomposition. Processing first 15."

**Skip criteria** — auto-skip these issues (log reason in progress table):
- Empty issue body or no identifiable acceptance criteria — needs requirements before implementation
- No code path (manual testing, design docs, decisions needed)
- Requires user input not present in the description
- Deployment/release tasks
- Issues labeled `blocked` or `wontfix`
- Issues requiring design decisions with multiple valid approaches not specified

If skipping, comment on the issue:

```bash
gh issue comment ${ISSUE_NUM} --body "Skipped during autonomous dev session — [reason]. Needs manual attention."
```

### Phase 1: Sync Check (before EACH issue)

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Check for any PRs merged by the user since last check:

```bash
gh pr list --state merged --json number,headRefName,mergedAt --limit 20 \
  | jq --arg prefix "${BRANCH_PREFIX}" '[.[] | select(.headRefName | startswith($prefix))]'
```

Note any merged PRs in the progress table. If on a stale branch, switch back to main.

Check for existing branches/PRs from a previous session for the current issue:

```bash
# Check if issue already has a PR (search by title reference)
gh pr list --json number,title,headRefName,state --limit 50 \
  | jq --arg num "${ISSUE_NUM}" '[.[] | select(.title | contains("#" + $num))]'

# Also check by branch prefix
gh pr list --json number,title,headRefName,state --limit 50 \
  | jq --arg prefix "${BRANCH_PREFIX}" '[.[] | select(.headRefName | startswith($prefix))]'
```

- Already merged → mark as done, skip
- Open PR exists → skip (user can re-queue if needed)
- Stale branch, no PR → delete branch, re-process

### Phase 2: Issue Understanding

```bash
gh issue view ${ISSUE_NUM} --json title,body,labels,comments
```

Read the full issue. Identify:
- **Files to modify** — use Glob/Grep to find relevant code
- **Test strategy** — what behavior to test, where tests go
- **Implementation approach** — minimal path to satisfy acceptance criteria

Explore the codebase to understand the relevant code before writing anything:

```bash
# Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
cat CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null

# Explore relevant files based on issue description
```

If the issue body is empty or has no actionable requirements, apply skip criteria from Phase 0.5.

### Phase 3: Implementation (TDD)

Create branch following project conventions:

```bash
# Generate slug from issue title: lowercase, hyphens, no special chars, max 40 chars
ISSUE_TITLE=$(gh issue view "${ISSUE_NUM}" --json title -q '.title')
SLUG=$(printf '%s' "${ISSUE_TITLE}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed -E 's/[^a-z0-9]+/-/g; s/^-+|-+$//g' | cut -c1-40)

# Create branch from issue number + slug
# {{CUSTOMIZE: Branch naming convention — e.g., auto/<number>-<slug> vs feat/<number>-<slug>}}
BRANCH="${BRANCH_PREFIX}${ISSUE_NUM}-${SLUG}"
git checkout -b "${BRANCH}"

# This is the branch THIS session created. Record it, and from here on assert it
# rather than trusting it — `git` HEAD is global to the working copy, so a
# concurrent session sharing this checkout can move it out from under you.
SESSION_BRANCH="${BRANCH}"
assert_branch() {
  local now; now="$(git branch --show-current)"
  [ "${now}" = "${SESSION_BRANCH}" ] || {
    echo "STOP: on '${now}', expected '${SESSION_BRANCH}' — HEAD moved under this session. Do not edit, do not stage." >&2
    return 1
  }
}
```

**CRITICAL: Always branch from main.** Never stack branches — each PR must be independently mergeable in any order.

**Assert the branch before you write.** Call `assert_branch` immediately before the first edit of this issue **and again immediately before staging** (Phase 4). A checkout from ten minutes ago proves nothing: another session sharing this working copy may have checked out its own branch since, and edits made in that state land on *its* branch. Re-check, never remember. If the assertion fails, stop and re-establish `SESSION_BRANCH` — do not edit, do not stage. Refuse to write to a branch this session did not create: if HEAD is some other session's branch, `git checkout "${SESSION_BRANCH}"` (or re-create it from main) first.

```bash
assert_branch || exit 1   # before the first edit
```

#### RED — Write Failing Tests First

Based on the issue's acceptance criteria, write tests that describe the desired behavior. Tests MUST fail before any implementation.

```bash
# {{CUSTOMIZE: Test runner command — e.g., npm test, pytest, godot --headless res://test/test_runner.tscn}}
# {{CUSTOMIZE: Test file conventions — e.g., __tests__/*.test.ts, *_test.gd, *.spec.js}}

# Run tests to confirm they fail
${TEST_COMMAND}
```

If tests pass immediately, the behavior already exists — investigate before proceeding. Either the issue is already resolved or the tests don't capture the right behavior.

#### GREEN — Make Tests Pass

Write the minimum implementation to make all new tests pass. Don't over-engineer — just satisfy the tests.

```bash
# Run tests to confirm they pass
${TEST_COMMAND}
```

If tests still fail, iterate on the implementation until they pass. Do NOT move to REFACTOR until all tests are green.

#### REFACTOR — Clean Up

With green tests as a safety net:
- Remove duplication
- Improve naming
- Simplify logic
- Ensure the code follows project conventions (per CLAUDE.md)

```bash
# Run tests again to confirm refactoring didn't break anything
${TEST_COMMAND}

# {{CUSTOMIZE: Lint/typecheck commands — e.g., npm run lint, npm run typecheck, mypy .}}
${LINT_COMMAND}
```

### Phase 4: Commit and PR Creation

**Stage explicit paths.** `git status --short` first, then `git add` the files you changed, **by name**. Never `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git add -u`, `git add <dir>/`, or `git commit -a`. The working copy is shared with concurrent sessions, so a bulk add commits whatever else happens to be in the tree. `-u` is not the safe one: it restages every *tracked* file whose worktree copy differs, including files a clean/smudge filter rewrote without you touching them — that is how `git add -u` turned a tracked 21KB `.docx` into a git-lfs pointer and committed it as an edit.

Stage and commit with conventional format:

```bash
# Re-assert the branch — this is the second mandatory check, and the one that
# stops another session's work being swept into this PR. (`assert_branch` is
# defined in Phase 3; re-declare it if this runs in a fresh shell.)
assert_branch || exit 1

# Look at what is actually there, then stage those paths by name.
git status --short
git add <specific-files>

# Commit with issue reference — NO attribution
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): description

Implements the core change described in the issue.

Refs #${ISSUE_NUM}
EOF
)"

# {{CUSTOMIZE: Commit scope conventions — e.g., server, app, core, ui}}

git push -u origin ${BRANCH}
```

Create PR autonomously (NO user confirmation — PRs are the async checkpoints):

```bash
# Construct PR title: conventional commit format referencing the issue
# Infer type from issue labels (bug→fix, enhancement→feat, etc.)
ISSUE_LABELS=$(gh issue view "${ISSUE_NUM}" --json labels -q '[.labels[].name] | join(",")')
case "${ISSUE_LABELS}" in
  *bug*) PR_TYPE="fix" ;;
  *test*) PR_TYPE="test" ;;
  *refactor*) PR_TYPE="refactor" ;;
  *) PR_TYPE="feat" ;;
esac
PR_TITLE="${PR_TYPE}: ${ISSUE_TITLE} (#${ISSUE_NUM})"

PR_URL=$(gh pr create \
  --title "${PR_TITLE}" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

- Change 1
- Change 2

Refs #${ISSUE_NUM}

## Test Plan

- [ ] All new tests pass
- [ ] Existing tests unbroken
{{CUSTOMIZE: PR test plan items — e.g., "- [ ] App type-checks clean", "- [ ] Manual smoke test"}}
EOF
)")

PR_NUM=$(echo "$PR_URL" | grep -oE '[0-9]+$')
```

### Phase 4.5: Smoke Test (if applicable)

If the PR modified **UI or frontend files**, run the project's smoke test to catch visual regressions before review. This prevents wasting review cycles on PRs that break the UI.

```bash
# {{CUSTOMIZE: Condition for when to run smoke test — e.g., check if PR touches dashboard/frontend files}}
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only main...HEAD)
if echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -qE '{{CUSTOMIZE: UI file pattern — e.g., dashboard|frontend|components|\.tsx$|\.css$}}'; then
  NEEDS_SMOKE_TEST=true
fi
```

If `NEEDS_SMOKE_TEST` is true:

1. **Rebuild UI** if needed (e.g., `npm run build`)
2. **Run `/smoke-test`** — this launches the app, opens a headless browser, and verifies key UI elements
3. **Check results:**
   - **All pass:** Continue to Phase 5 (review)
   - **Failures:** Read the screenshots, diagnose whether it's an app bug or a test selector issue
     - **App bug:** Fix the code, re-run tests, amend commit, re-run smoke test
     - **Test issue:** Note it in the PR description, continue (don't block on flaky test selectors)
4. **Max 2 smoke test fix attempts** — if still failing after 2 fixes, flag the PR as "Needs attention (smoke test failure)" and move on

If `NEEDS_SMOKE_TEST` is false, skip directly to Phase 5.

**CRITICAL:** The smoke test must NOT send real messages or create persistent state. It only verifies UI rendering and navigation.

### Phase 5: Full Review

**Pre-Skill Checkpoint** (MANDATORY — prevents context drift in long sessions):
1. Re-read CLAUDE.md for project conventions
2. Re-read the skill files for /full-review, /agent-review, and /check-pr

Run `/full-review ${PR_NUM}`:
- Phase 1: Agent review — deep expert review against project standards
- Phase 2: Check-PR — process all review comments (Copilot + agent-review findings)

Capture results: verdict, findings counts, fixes committed, issues created/closed.

**If critical findings exist:** Fix them (standard /full-review behavior handles this). Two fix attempts max — after that, flag the PR as "Needs attention" and move on.

**Merge — or don't — exactly as Critical Rule 5 directs.** Rule 5 records whether this repo grants unattended merge authority at all; it is the only place that decides, and nothing here overrides it. If rule 5 grants gated self-merge: when the verdict is clean, ALL CI checks pass on the final commit, and ALL review threads are resolved, merge per repo convention (see `unattended-merge`), verify the PR reports `MERGED`, and record the merge as an entry in the final session report. NEVER use `gh pr merge --auto` or GitHub auto-merge — verify the gates first, then merge synchronously. If any gate fails, do NOT merge: flag the PR for the user with the failed gate named and keep working. If rule 5 withholds merge authority, leave the PR open and flag it — a clean review is not a reason to revisit that.

### Phase 6: Assess, Report, and Continue

Based on /full-review results, classify the PR:

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Clean | No critical findings, all comments addressed | Edit PR body: `Refs` → `Closes`. Then follow Critical Rule 5: if this repo grants gated self-merge, merge and record the entry; if it withholds merge authority, flag the PR and leave it open. Mark the issue done, continue |
| Needs attention | Critical findings or unresolved comments | Keep `Refs` (don't auto-close). Flag for user, continue |
| Broken | Tests failing after review fixes | Keep `Refs` (don't auto-close). Flag for user, continue |

Update task tracking:

```
TaskUpdate: "Issue #N" → completed (or flagged)
```

Output cumulative progress table:

```markdown
## Session Progress ({completed}/{total})

| # | Issue | Branch | PR | Smoke | Review | Status |
|---|-------|--------|----|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | #12 — Add retry logic | 12-add-retry | #45 | — | Approve (0 critical) | Done |
| 2 | #15 — Add leaderboard | — | — | — | — | Decomposed → #20, #21 |
| 3 | #20 — Leaderboard data model | 20-lb-model | #46 | 12/13 | Approve (1 suggestion) | Done |
| 4 | #18 — Add auth tests | — | — | — | — | In progress |
| 5 | #22 — Update error handling | — | — | — | — | Queued |
```

**CRITICAL: Never block the session on a flagged PR.** Flag and move on. The user handles flagged PRs during check-ins.

Return to Phase 1 for next issue.

### Phase 7: Session Summary

After all issues are processed (or the queue is exhausted), output final summary:

```markdown
## Autonomous Dev Session Complete

**Issues processed:** {N}
**Queue source:** {description}

### Results

| # | Issue | PR | Smoke | Review Verdict | Status |
|---|-------|----|-------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | #12 — Add retry logic | [#45](url) | — | Approve | Merged (`abc1234`) |
| 2 | #15 — Add leaderboard | — | — | — | Decomposed → #20, #21, #22 |
| 3 | #20 — Leaderboard data model | [#46](url) | 12/13 | Approve | Merged (`def5678`) |
| 4 | #18 — Add auth tests | [#47](url) | — | Request Changes | Needs attention |

### Merged by this session

One entry per self-merged PR — MANDATORY (Unattended Merge Gate rule 6). Omit this whole section when Critical Rule 5 withholds merge authority for this repo: there is nothing to report, and an empty "Merged by this session" table invites the reader to assume a merge happened:

| PR | Issue | Review | Checks | Merge SHA |
|----|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| [#45](url) | #12 — Add retry logic | Approve, 0 unresolved | all green | `abc1234` |
| [#46](url) | #20 — Leaderboard data model | Approve, 0 unresolved | all green | `def5678` |

### Summary
- **Merged this session:** N PRs (entries above)
- **Open / needs attention:** M PRs (details below)
- **Decomposed:** K issues → L sub-issues created
- **Skipped:** J issues (reasons below)
- **Issues created during reviews:** #A, #B, #C
- **PRs merged by user during session:** #X, #Y

### Needs Attention
- **PR #47** (#18 — Add auth tests): 1 critical finding — auth token not validated before use. See review comment.

### Skipped Issues
- **#25**: Requires deployment setup — not automatable
- **#30**: Needs user decision on provider choice

### Next Steps
- Review the merged-PR entries (post-merge audit)
- Address flagged PRs (each names its failed gate)
- Review created issues for follow-up work
```

## Session Boundaries

Long autonomous runs are a sequence of bounded sessions, not one endless context — context re-reads dominate their cost, and a restart that halves context pays for itself within ~6–10 requests. When this skill runs inside a marathon (`/tackle-issues`), the wave boundary is the session boundary; run standalone, apply the same discipline at wave boundaries of its own (queue checkpoints — every few issues, and always before starting a large one). How a session ends at a wave boundary is **mode-aware**:

- **Attended runs** — end the session at the wave boundary; the user/orchestrator relaunches the next segment seeded from a **new** dated handoff note ({{CUSTOMIZE: handoff-note path — default `docs/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`}}) — add a file, never rewrite the previous boundary's — plus the queue ({{CUSTOMIZE: queue path — default `scratchpad/autonomous-queue.json`}}).
- **Unattended with a configured re-launcher** ({{CUSTOMIZE: wave re-launcher — e.g. chroxy scheduled trigger, cron/launchd job, /loop wrapper; leave "none" if absent}}) — end the session; the re-launcher starts the next segment from the same seeds, and its task text **names the dated handoff file explicitly, never a pointer that can move**.
- **Unattended with no re-launcher** — do **NOT** end the session (nothing would relaunch it): write the handoff seed, force/await a compaction at the boundary so the next segment starts lean, and continue. The cost goal — shed context at the boundary — holds in every mode.
- **A boundary seed is not written until it is committed — and it carries the header the selector reads.** Two non-optional halves, in every mode above:

  **① The header.** Several boundaries can fall on one day, so the filename date cannot order them and the frontmatter timestamp is the only thing that can. Write the header `/session-lifecycle` End step 1 prescribes — `type: handoff`, `date:` as a **full unquoted UTC timestamp** (`2026-08-11T21:40Z`), `repo:`, `picks_up_at:`, `sensitivity:` — and name the file `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` with zero-padded fields. A seed with no header, or a name in any other shape, is one the newest-seed rule cannot place: it does not lose quietly, it forces the next session to stop and disambiguate by hand.

  **② The commit.** Immediately after writing it, before the queue refresh and before anything else touches git:

  ```bash
  git status --short
  git add docs/handoffs/<file>        # by name — never -A, -u, . or a directory
  git commit -m "docs(handoffs): record the <date> session boundary"
  git push
  git cat-file -e "origin/$(git branch --show-current):docs/handoffs/<file>" && echo durable
  ```

  Until `durable` prints, the seed is an untracked file in this segment's worktree and nowhere else, and `git worktree remove --force` — the fleet's standard teardown — deletes it silently and unrecoverably. **Never tear down the worktree, and never end the session, before that line prints.**

- **~150K main-thread context ceiling.** Past ~150K tokens of main-thread context, finish the current issue only, write the short handoff note (queue position, open blockers, awaiting-user items, last verified merge), and end the session (unattended with no re-launcher: force a compaction instead). Resume Strategy below makes the fresh session lossless — it re-derives progress from GitHub state, so the handoff plus the queue is all the seed a restart needs.
- **Cost circuit breaker at wave boundaries (queue checkpoints).** At each boundary, check session cost ({{CUSTOMIZE: cost source — e.g. the statusline computes it; name the per-session budget, e.g. "$X eq."}}). Over budget → write the handoff and **stop and notify** instead of continuing. This breaker is the sole sanctioned exception to Critical Rule 4's "everything after is fully autonomous".
- **Verify state directly.** A background monitor ending is not a verdict — assert PR/CI state with a direct query before recording it, and re-check `mergeStateStatus` at the current head after any push.

## Resume Strategy

This skill resumes from **GitHub state** — GitHub remains the source of truth for issue/PR status. The wave handoff note (Session Boundaries) carries only session-boundary seeds — queue position, open blockers, awaiting-user items, last verified merge — and is disposable: everything in it is re-derivable from GitHub. It is a seed for the next segment, not a second source of truth.

If a session is interrupted (crash, timeout, user stops it), re-running with the same arguments will:

1. Query GitHub for existing session branches (matching `BRANCH_PREFIX`) and PRs referencing each issue
2. Skip issues that already have merged or open PRs
3. Resume from the first issue without a PR

This makes the skill **idempotent** — safe to re-run without duplicating work. The same idempotence is what makes deliberate session-boundary restarts (above) lossless.

## Critical Rules

1. **NO attribution** — No Co-Authored-By, no "Generated with Claude", no AI mentions anywhere. Zero Attribution Policy.
2. **TDD is mandatory** — RED → GREEN → REFACTOR for every issue. No skipping tests. If pure docs/config, note why tests are N/A.
3. **Branch from main every time** — Never stack branches. Each PR is independently mergeable in any order.
4. **One confirmation point** — The initial queue approval. Everything after is fully autonomous; the sole sanctioned stop is the cost circuit breaker (see Session Boundaries).
5. **Self-merge authority for this repo** — {{CUSTOMIZE: This repo's self-merge posture, written as a directive. This is the SINGLE source of truth: every merge step in this skill defers to this rule, so write exactly one of the two below and delete the other. GATED (the usual choice): "Merge only through the Unattended Merge Gate — /full-review clean + ALL checks green on the final commit + ALL review threads resolved. No `gh pr merge --auto`, no GitHub auto-merge, no protection overrides. A failed gate means flag, don't merge. Every self-merged PR MUST appear as an entry in the final session report." WITHHELD, for repos where every merge must be a human act: "NEVER merge, however clean the PR is. This repo does not grant unattended merge authority and the Unattended Merge Gate does not apply here. PRs accumulate for user review — flag each finished PR in the session report and keep working. A clean gate is not permission, because there is no gate to pass."}}
6. **Never block on review findings** — Flag and move on. The user handles flagged PRs during check-ins.
7. **Two fix attempts max** — If /full-review finds critical issues, fix them. If a second attempt still fails, flag and move on.
8. **Progress table after every issue** — The user may check in at any time. The table must be current.
9. **Respect the hard cap** — Max 15 issues per session segment (wave). Refuse larger queues.
10. **Resume from GitHub state** — GitHub is the source of truth for issue/PR status; query branches matching `BRANCH_PREFIX` and PR titles to detect prior work. The wave handoff note is a disposable session-boundary seed, never a second source of truth.
11. **Compose existing skills** — /full-review is called as-is (chains /agent-review → /check-pr). Don't reinvent their logic.
12. **Decompose, don't skip** — High-complexity issues get broken into sub-issues, not skipped. Only skip truly non-automatable work.
13. **Comment on skips** — Every skipped issue gets a GitHub comment explaining why. The user sees the reason.
14. **Pre-Skill Checkpoint** — Re-read CLAUDE.md and skill files before running /full-review to prevent context drift.
15. **Sync before branching** — Always `git checkout main && git pull` before starting each issue. Check for merged PRs first.
16. **Explicit-path staging** — `git status --short`, then `git add` the changed files by name. Never `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git add -u`, `git add <dir>/`, or `git commit -a`. `-u` is not the safe one: it restages tracked files a clean/smudge filter rewrote behind your back, which is how a tracked 21KB `.docx` was committed as a git-lfs pointer.
17. **Assert the branch before you write** — record the branch you create as `SESSION_BRANCH` and re-check `git branch --show-current` against it immediately before the first edit and again immediately before staging. HEAD is global to the working copy; a concurrent session can move it after you branched. Never write to a branch this session did not create.

## Customization Points

Lines and sections marked with `{{CUSTOMIZE}}` need repo-specific adaptation:

- **Default issue label** for work queue (e.g., `ready-to-build`, `ready`, `accepted`)
- **Branch prefix** for session branches and resume detection (e.g., `auto/` or `feat/`, `fix/`, etc.)
- **Branch naming convention** (e.g., `auto/<number>-<slug>` vs `feat/<number>-<slug>`)
- **Decomposition trigger label** (e.g., `complexity:high`)
- **Test runner command** (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`, `godot --headless res://test/test_runner.tscn`)
- **Test file conventions** (e.g., `__tests__/*.test.ts`, `*_test.gd`, `*.spec.js`)
- **Lint/typecheck commands** (e.g., `npm run lint && npm run typecheck`, `mypy .`)
- **PR test plan items** (e.g., "App type-checks clean", "Manual smoke test")
- **Commit scope conventions** (e.g., `server`, `app`, `core`, `ui`)
- **Smoke test condition** — file patterns that trigger the smoke test (e.g., `dashboard|\.tsx$|\.css$`)
- **Smoke test UI rebuild command** (e.g., `npm run dashboard:build`)
- **Smoke test invocation** — how to run the `/smoke-test` skill or script
- **Cost source + per-session budget** — where session cost is read (e.g. the statusline) and the budget the circuit breaker enforces (Session Boundaries)
- **Handoff-note path** — where wave handoff notes live, default `docs/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, committed, with the `/session-lifecycle` End-step-1 frontmatter (Session Boundaries)
- **Queue path** — where the durable wave queue lives, default `scratchpad/autonomous-queue.json` (Session Boundaries)
- **Wave re-launcher** — what restarts the next segment in unattended runs (scheduled trigger, cron/launchd job, /loop wrapper), or "none" (Session Boundaries)
