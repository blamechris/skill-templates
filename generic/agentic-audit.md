# /agentic-audit

Launch a panel of specialized agents to audit a pull request from multiple perspectives before merge.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - PR number (optional, defaults to current branch's PR), plus optional agent count (default: 5). Examples:
  - `42` (PR #42, 5 agents)
  - `42 7` (PR #42, 7 agents)
  - `3` (PR #3 or 3 agents — resolved by checking if a PR with that number exists)

## Instructions

### 1. Gather PR Context

```bash
PR_NUM=${1:-$(gh pr view --json number -q .number)}
AGENT_COUNT=${2:-5}  # min: 3, max: 8
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)

# PR metadata
gh pr view ${PR_NUM} --json title,body,headRefName,baseRefName,files,additions,deletions

# Full diff
gh pr diff ${PR_NUM}

# Changed file list
gh pr view ${PR_NUM} --json files -q '.files[].path'
```

Build a context bundle for agents containing: PR title, description, branch names, full diff, and the list of changed files.

### 2. Select Agents

Pick AGENT_COUNT agents from the roster. Always include the core 3. Fill remaining slots from the extended roster based on what the diff touches.

#### Core (always included)

| Agent | Lens | Personality |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Skeptic | Correctness, false assumptions, logic errors, what will break | Cynical engineer who has seen too many PRs ship bugs. Reads every line of the diff looking for what's wrong. |
| Builder | Completeness, missing edge cases, integration gaps, unfinished work | Pragmatic dev who has to maintain this code. Finds what's missing, incomplete, or will cause follow-up PRs. |
| Minimalist | Over-engineering, unnecessary changes, scope creep, simpler alternatives | Believes the best PR is the smallest PR. Finds what to cut and proposes leaner approaches. |

#### Extended (pick by relevance to the diff)

| Agent | Lens | Include When |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Guardian | Failure modes, race conditions, data integrity, error handling | Changes touch concurrency, state management, data persistence, or error paths |
| Operator | UX impact, user-facing regressions, accessibility, error states | Changes touch UI, user flows, or output formatting |
| Futurist | Tech debt introduced, maintainability cost, extensibility impact | Changes introduce new patterns, abstractions, or architectural decisions |
| Adversary | Security holes, input validation, auth bypass, injection vectors | Changes touch auth, user input, API boundaries, or external data |
| Tester | Test coverage, untested paths, edge cases, test quality | Changes include complex logic, new features, or modify existing tests |

### 3. Launch Agents

Launch all agents in parallel using the Task tool. Each agent receives the full PR context bundle and their persona.

**Agent prompt:**

```
You are "{AGENT_NAME}" — {PERSONALITY}

Audit this pull request from the lens of **{LENS}**.

## PR Context
- **Title**: {PR_TITLE}
- **Branch**: {HEAD} → {BASE}
- **Changed files**: {FILE_LIST}

## Diff
{FULL_DIFF}

## PR Description
{PR_BODY}

## Your Review
1. Rate the PR overall 1–5
2. List your top findings (up to 5), each with:
   - Severity: critical / major / minor / nit
   - File and line reference
   - What's wrong and why it matters
   - Suggested fix (concrete, not vague)
3. Note anything done well worth preserving
4. One-paragraph verdict

## Rules
- Review the DIFF, but also read surrounding code in changed files for context.
- Be specific. Reference exact lines. "This might be a problem" is useless.
- Be opinionated. Strong views, loosely held.
- 3/5 = adequate, would merge with minor comments. 5/5 = exemplary. 1/5 = should not merge.
```

Run agents as foreground Task calls. If more than 4 agents, batch: first 4 in parallel, then the rest.

### 4. Synthesize and Report

After all agents return, output a single synthesis directly to the user (no files written):

```markdown
## Agentic Audit: PR #{PR_NUM} — {TITLE}

**Agents**: {count} | **Aggregate**: {average}/5

### Agent Panel
| Agent | Rating | Top Finding |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Skeptic | X/5 | One-line summary |
| Builder | X/5 | One-line summary |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Consensus Findings
Issues where 3+ agents agree. These are high-confidence and should be addressed.

1. **{Finding}** (Skeptic, Builder, Guardian) — {description + file:line}
2. ...

### Contested Points
Where agents disagree. Present both sides, assess who's right.

### Action Items
Prioritized list of recommended changes before merge, ordered by severity.

### Verdict
One paragraph: merge as-is, merge with changes, or rework needed.
```

### 5. Offer Next Steps

After presenting the synthesis, ask the user:

> Want me to fix any of the findings? I can address them as commits on this branch.

## Rating Scale

| Rating | Meaning |
|:------:|---------|
| 5 | Exemplary — would merge without comment |
| 4 | Good — minor issues, none blocking |
| 3 | Adequate — merge with changes |
| 2 | Concerning — significant issues to resolve first |
| 1 | Do not merge — needs rework |
